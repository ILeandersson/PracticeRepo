# Working with Pull Requests (PR)

### How to Create a PR
Most engineers manage their repos through PRs. This is how contributors can make suggestions or contributions without committing directly to the main branch, aka *the source of all truth*. In the [ReadMe](https://github.com/christinerose/PracticeRepo), you learned how to fork and branch within the GitHub interface. Once you make your changes, you will see a big green button like this:

<insert PR button>
  
Click on it, and it will take you to the main repo to commit. 
  1. Write a brief, helpful description of the changes
  2. Click commit
  3. Make note of the PR # / URL for your records, if needed.
  
  Voil√†! You've created a PR!
